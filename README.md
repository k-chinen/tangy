tangy
=====

tangy is picture generator.
It is inspired by pic (roff pre-processor).
Using the language, you can draw picture in EPS (Encapsuled Postscript) file.
For example, following script makes DB, client and their communication
through Internet.

    drum "DB"
    arrow
    cloud "Internet"
    arrow
    circle "client"
